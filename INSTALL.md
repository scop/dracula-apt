### [APT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APT_%28software%29)

> Note: APT versions older than 2.9 use only a subset of the theme colors.

#### Install using Git

If you are a git user, you can install the theme and keep up to date by cloning the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dracula/apt.git
```

#### Install manually

Download using the [GitHub `.zip` download](https://github.com/dracula/apt/archive/main.zip) option and unzip them.

#### Activating theme

The `50dracula-colors.conf` file contains the theme.

Place it in `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/`; either by copying, or by symlinking from a git checkout you intend to keep around and update.
